# Changelog

All notable changes to **Drydock**.

## [2.5.0] — 2026-06-25

Extends the team past engineering into the full product cycle. Drydock shipped production-ready *software* well; it now also designs the UX and takes the product to market. Four new agents bring the roster from **15 to 19** and add a new **LAUNCH** phase after SHIP.

### Added
- **UX Designer** (`ux-designer`, DEFINE→BUILD) — the one missing *engineering-adjacent* role. Owns user research, information architecture, interaction design, and the **design-system SPECIFICATION** (tokens, type scale, WCAG-AA color, component specs, states, motion) that frontend-engineer implements. Phases: discovery → IA → design-system spec → interaction design → usability/accessibility.
- **Growth Marketer** (`growth-marketer`, LAUNCH) — positioning, messaging, GTM/launch plan, marketing-site copy + SEO briefs, funnels/analytics, and growth experiments. Phases: positioning → launch plan → website & content → funnels & analytics → growth metrics.
- **Sales Strategist** (`sales-strategist`, LAUNCH) — pricing & packaging, sales collateral, sales process/qualification, enablement, and proposals. Turns the **security-engineer + compliance-officer evidence into a buyer-facing trust pack**. Phases: pricing & packaging → collateral → process → enablement & trust → proposals (legal artifacts flagged "requires legal review").
- **Customer Success** (`customer-success`, LAUNCH→SUSTAIN) — onboarding/activation, support operations, retention/churn, and the voice-of-customer loop back to product-manager. Phases: onboarding → support ops → retention/churn → voice-of-customer.
- **New LAUNCH phase** (`skills/drydock/phases/launch.md`) — runs after SHIP/Gate 3, dispatching the three GTM agents in parallel; customer-success carries into SUSTAIN. Full pipeline is now DEFINE→BUILD→HARDEN→SHIP→**LAUNCH**→SUSTAIN.
- **Two new modes** — **Design (UX)** (single-skill, routes to ux-designer) and **Launch (GTM)** (multi-skill, GTM-plan gate), plus `/drydock design` and `/drydock just launch` partial-execution commands. 12 → 14 modes.

### Changed
- Orchestrator wired for all four: request-classification + gate tables, phase-execution table, internal-parallelism, dispatch list, context-bridging, workspace dirs, and partial-execution. Counts updated everywhere (15→19 agents, 12→14 modes) across `drydock/SKILL.md`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and `README.md` (including the pipeline diagram, the agent roster, and the direct-invocation table).
- **Pipeline dispatchers + references wired to match the roster, not just the orchestrator surface.** `phases/define.md` now actually dispatches the **UX Designer (T2b)** in parallel with the architect once Gate 1 passes (conditional on `features.frontend`), and the DEFINE→BUILD handoff verifies its receipt and re-anchors on `docs/design/`. `phases/build.md` + `frontend-engineer` Phase 1–2 make the `docs/design/` design-system spec the **source of truth** the frontend implements (rather than inventing tokens). `reference/task-graph.md` adds T2b and the **LAUNCH wave (T14–T16)** to the DAG, dependency tables, dynamic-generation steps, and conditional-task list; `phases/full-build-setup.md` creates the new tasks. This closes the gap where SKILL.md advertised T2b/LAUNCH but the dispatchers never ran them.
- **Maintainer docs synced to the new ground truth.** `DEV_PROTOCOL.md` cross-reference counts + context-cost model and `VISION.md` updated to **19 agents / 19 skills / 6 phase dispatchers** (14 protocols, 11 principles, 3 gates unchanged).
- `conflict-resolution.md` gains four authority rows + boundary clarifications enforcing non-overlap: ux-designer owns the design *spec* (frontend implements it), growth-marketer owns positioning (sales consumes it), customer-success routes feedback to PM (doesn't change requirements).
- Structural evals updated to the new ground truth (15 agents / 19 skills). All 19 worker/main-context skills stay within the 500-line progressive-disclosure budget; **11/11 deterministic evals pass**.

## [2.4.0] — 2026-06-25

Frontend production-grade upgrade. The `frontend-engineer` skill was already strong (atomic components, WCAG 2.1 AA, React Query, OpenAPI-typed clients, RFC 9457 errors, frontend observability, perf budgets, feature flags); this closes the remaining gaps to production-grade and makes the **framework choice product-driven** instead of a blanket Next.js default.

### Added
- **Product-driven framework selection** (`01-analysis.md`). Phase 0 is now a decision matrix: architect's `tech-stack.md` wins → brownfield matches existing → else choose by product archetype — **Astro** (content/marketing, SEO-critical), **Next.js App Router** (full-stack SaaS), **React + Vite** (internal-tool/admin SPA), **Remix/React Router v7** (form-heavy). The design system, a11y, observability, security, i18n, and testing standards are framework-stable; only routing/rendering/data-loading vary. Choice recorded in `framework-decision.md`.
- **Internationalization (i18n)** end to end — foundation in `02-design-system.md` (provider + message catalogs + `Intl` formatting + RTL via `dir`/logical properties), no-hardcoded-strings + RTL-safe rule on every component (`03-components.md`), locale routing + `hreflang` (`04-pages-routes.md`), and a pseudo-locale + RTL render check (`06-testing-a11y.md`). Scales to the Phase-1 decision: multi-locale gets full routing; single-locale still externalizes strings so a second locale is a config change.
- **Image & web-performance optimization** — an optimized `Image` primitive (explicit dimensions for zero CLS, lazy, AVIF/WebP, required `alt`), optimized font loading (`font-display: swap` + preload + subset), and a Phase-4 performance section: route-level code-splitting, waterfall-free parallel data loading, Suspense streaming, LCP prioritization, and bundle hygiene — all feeding the existing Phase-6 Core Web Vitals/size budget gate.
- **SEO & discoverability** (`04-pages-routes.md`) — per-route metadata + canonical + Open Graph + schema.org **JSON-LD**, generated **`sitemap.xml`** and **`robots.txt`** for public/indexable routes; behind-auth routes `noindex`.
- **Production-grade form system** (`03-components.md`) — react-hook-form + Zod resolver (reusing the OpenAPI-generated schemas), multi-step/wizard forms, field arrays, async/server-error mapping to fields, a focusable accessible error summary, autosave/draft, and an unsaved-changes guard.

### Changed
- **Functional verification is now EXECUTED, not reasoned.** Phase 4b's "interaction trace" was a *mental* walk-through; it is now an executed Playwright smoke (`frontend/tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`) that builds + boots the app and asserts each top-5 flow reaches its correct final state. A failing flow is a Critical defect that blocks Phase 5; the smoke spec seeds the qa-engineer's full E2E suite. If the app can't be booted in-environment, the spec is produced and handed to qa as a required gate, recorded as deferred (not skipped).
- SKILL identity, phase index, output contract (i18n messages, SEO artifacts, smoke spec), and Common Mistakes updated for all of the above.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-06-25

Production-grade security hardening. The audit (HARDEN) phase already covered OWASP Top 10 / API / LLM thoroughly; this release closes the **BUILD↔AUDIT asymmetry** — control families the security audit checks for are now written into the secure-by-default BUILD contract so builder agents ship them in the first draft instead of relying on HARDEN to retrofit. Grounded in an evidence-based gap analysis cross-referenced against the current standards (OWASP ASVS 5.0, API Security Top 10 2023, LLM Top 10 2025, OWASP Top 10 CI/CD Security Risks, SLSA v1.2).

### Added
- **Seven new secure-by-default sections in `security-defaults.md`** (each ASVS 5.0 / Proactive-Controls tagged and asserted in the BUILD Quality Bar line): **Strong cryptography** (Argon2id/scrypt/bcrypt credential hashing, AES-GCM/ChaCha20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption, CSPRNG for all tokens/ids, TLS 1.2+); **Authentication & credential-handling** (throttle + lockout, MFA hook, breach-screened password policy, safe recovery, no user enumeration); **Session & self-contained-token lifecycle** (CSPRNG session ids, regeneration on privilege change, idle+absolute timeout, server-side revoke, JWT alg-allowlist rejecting `alg=none` + `exp`/`iss`/`aud`); **Resource-consumption & anti-automation limits** (body/page/depth/upload caps, timeouts, per-tenant quotas, anti-automation on sensitive flows — API4/API6); **Property-level authorization / mass assignment** (bind allowlisted fields, server-side `role`/`tenant`/`owner`, DTO-shaped responses — API3/BOPLA); **Treat third-party/upstream responses as untrusted** (schema-validate, size/timeout caps, verify webhooks — API10); **Security event logging** (A09 / ASVS V16).
- **Backend BUILD phases wired to assert the new defaults** — `software-engineer` 03-cross-cutting (extended rate-limiting into full resource-consumption limits + a security-event-logging HARD RULE + crypto/auth/session/property-authz in §3.11), 02-service-implementation (per-handler property-level authz + resource limits), 04-integration (new "treat upstream as untrusted" section). Each adds the control to its local Validation Loop / Quality Bar.
- **Frontend browser hardening** (`frontend-engineer` 02-design-system + SKILL + 06-testing-a11y): Subresource Integrity on external scripts, `__Host-`/`__Secure-` cookie prefixes, Cross-Origin-Opener/Resource-Policy + COEP, Trusted Types (`require-trusted-types-for 'script'`), HSTS `preload`, and `Cache-Control: no-store` on sensitive responses — all asserted in the E2E security-header test.
- **Security-event logging contract** in `observability-contract.md` — a distinct stdout security-event stream keyed by a stable `event` field (`auth.success/failure`, `auth.logout`, `auth.credential_change`, `authz.denied`, `authz.role_change`, `input.rejected`) with fixed field names, a no-secrets/PII rule, and a SIEM/alerting hand-off to devops/sre.
- **CI/CD & supply-chain hardening** (`devops` 06-security, 03-cicd-pipelines, templates): dependency-confusion controls (CICD-SEC-3), Poisoned-Pipeline-Execution guardrails (CICD-SEC-4), CI/CD identity & access (CICD-SEC-2), runner isolation (CICD-SEC-5), CI/CD audit→SIEM (CICD-SEC-10), and SLSA v1.2 source-track integrity (signed commits, no force-push). The `ci.yml` template gains a tfsec/checkov IaC gate (fail on HIGH) wired into the build chain; `cd-production.yml` now **signs the SBOM** (`cosign attest`, in-toto SPDX keyed to the digest) and **verifies the attestation as a blocking gate**.
- **AI/LLM build-side controls** (`data-scientist` phases): model/dataset provenance + signature verification as a hard promotion gate and unsafe-deserialization scanning (LLM03), vector-store per-tenant isolation + per-retrieval authz + embedding-poisoning guards (LLM08), data-poisoning defenses (LLM04), RAG grounding / misinformation labeling (LLM09), and runtime token/cost/consumption limits (LLM10).
- **Audit trail for the secret-guard hook** — every BLOCK and every `DRYDOCK_ALLOW_SECRET=1` bypass is appended as one JSON line to `drydock/.orchestrator/audit/secret-guard.jsonl` in a Drydock project (best-effort; never fails the hook).

### Changed
- **`session-guard.sh` anchors detection to `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`** instead of the process cwd; **`hooks.json`** now verifies each hook script is a regular file before invoking it. The secret-guard header documents its intentional **fail-open trust model** (a broken guard never wedges a session; the plugin dir is trusted installed code).

### Fixed
- **Open-redirect guidance in `frontend-engineer/SKILL.md`** — the auth-callback anti-pattern now requires validating `callbackUrl` as a same-origin / allowlisted relative path before redirecting (rejecting absolute/cross-origin URLs); honoring an unvalidated `callbackUrl` is called out as an open redirect.
- **OWASP Top 10 2025 labeled as Release Candidate 1** (published 6 Nov 2025, not yet ratified; 2021 remains the last finalized edition) across `security-engineer` code-audit + SKILL. The A01–A10:2025 category mappings are unchanged (correct against RC1); reports are labeled "OWASP Top 10:2025 RC1".

## [2.2.1] — 2026-06-25

Patch fix for a skill-load failure on permission-checked setups (e.g. the VS Code extension and managed installs).

### Fixed
- **Skill `!` protocol loaders no longer hard-fail the permission check.** Every
  worker `SKILL.md` loaded shared protocols with a compound shell line —
  `cat "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/…" || cat "$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR/…" || cat drydock/.protocols/… || true`.
  Claude Code decomposes compound commands at `||` and requires each sub-command
  to be allow-listed, so skill expansion failed with *"This Bash command contains
  multiple operations … require approval"* — most visibly on the orchestrator, the
  one skill with no `allowed-tools`. Loaders are now SINGLE commands that call two
  bundled helpers — `skills/_shared/load-protocol.sh` (protocol name → 3-path
  fallback) and `skills/_shared/load-file.sh` (project file → `cat`, directory →
  `ls`) — which do the fallback internally and always exit 0. Every skill now
  declares narrow `allowed-tools` grants for those two helpers, so loaders run with
  no prompt and no user-side settings, marketplace installs included. The helpers
  reject absolute paths, parent traversal, and non-slug protocol names.

### Changed
- **`test_loader_resolution.py` now guards the single-command convention** — it
  fails on any `!` loader containing a compound operator (the exact regression
  fixed here), checks every `load-protocol.sh` reference resolves to a real
  protocol file, and exercises both helpers across all fallback scenarios plus
  their traversal guards.

## [2.2.0] — 2026-06-25

Marketplace-submission release. The plugin is renamed to **drydock**, engagement modes become **autonomy levels**, the documentation is hardened and clarified for publication, and the findings from a pre-submission audit are fixed. No change to generated-artifact behavior or the public skill contract beyond the rename.

### Renamed
- **Plugin renamed `shipyard` → `drydock`** ahead of the community-marketplace
  submission (the name `shipyard` was already taken by a different plugin). This
  changes the install name (`drydock`), the skill namespace (`drydock:<skill>`),
  the `/drydock` command, the runtime workspace directory (`drydock/`), and the
  project config file (`.drydock.yaml`). The GitHub repository itself stays at
  `sundarshahi/drydock`. Verified by the eval suite, `validate --strict`, and a
  live routing smoke test (`route='drydock:drydock'`, zero plugin errors).
- **Engagement modes renamed to "Autonomy Levels"** — the four levels
  `Express / Standard / Thorough / Meticulous` are now
  `Autopilot / Copilot / Checkpoint / Manual`, and the concept "engagement mode"
  is now "autonomy level" (how many decisions the pipeline surfaces to the user).
  Applied consistently across all 15 agents and the shared protocols; the default
  is **Copilot**. Naming only — the behavioral spectrum (Autopilot = fully
  autonomous → Manual = reviews every decision) is unchanged.

### Docs
- **Documentation hardened for the marketplace submission.** `DEV_PROTOCOL.md`
  corrected: agent/protocol counts fixed (15 agents, 14 shared protocols), version
  examples aligned to the `2.x` line, the competitive-analysis tables rewritten as
  capability-focused language (no named third-party products), and stale
  original-project references removed. `SECURITY.md` supported-versions table
  aligned to `2.1.x`. `README.md` "Autonomy Levels" section rewritten with clearer
  selection guidance. `VISION.md` rephrased for clarity — goal-first framing, the
  three gates named consistently (Requirements / Architecture / Production
  Readiness), and the autonomy-level terminology applied; all eleven principles and
  their hard rules are preserved.
- **README rewritten for first-time readers** — a plain-language intro, a
  quick-start with a concrete example, and a clearer pipeline diagram (the three
  gates shown as explicit approval points, parallel phases marked). `SECURITY.md`
  scope corrected to the actual executable surface — both hooks (`secret-guard.sh`,
  `session-guard.sh`) plus the bundled `bootstrap-workspace.sh` / `verify-gate.py`
  / `aggregate-cost.py` scripts. `CONTRIBUTING.md` CI description updated to the
  current `claude plugin validate . --strict` + deterministic-evals workflows.

### Changed
- **`product-manager` is now self-contained** — it no longer invokes the external
  `superpowers:writing-plans` skill; when an implementation outline is needed it
  writes a lightweight inline task breakdown (detailed planning is owned downstream
  by the orchestrator and Solution Architect). Removes a hard dependency on a
  third-party plugin.

### Fixed
- **Pre-submission audit fixes.** (1) `code-reviewer` dispatched its four parallel
  review sub-tasks to `phases/0X-*.md` checklist files that do not exist — the
  content is inline in the SKILL.md — so the dispatch now points at the inline
  Phase 1–4 sections, restoring the review checklists. (2) The `plugin.json`
  description claimed all 15 agents run as isolated subagents; corrected to "11 of
  15" (the orchestrator and three planning agents run in-context as skills).
  (3) The "12 execution modes" claim is reconciled with the orchestrator's
  classification table (12 routed modes **plus a Custom fallback**).
- **Autonomy-level prompt made reliable for Full Build.** The instruction to ask
  the user's Autonomy Level (and Parallelism) lived only in step 5 of a referenced
  phase file and could be skipped, so a build could start without ever asking. The
  always-loaded orchestrator `SKILL.md` now carries an explicit **MANDATORY**
  instruction to present both `AskUserQuestion` prompts before any agent is
  dispatched. Also fixed four autonomy-concept `engagement` references the rename
  missed (orchestrator phase index, Full Build section, the cost-estimation note,
  and the `ux-protocol` autonomy/involvement line). The security term **"Rules of
  Engagement" (RoE) / "Engagement Scope"** in the VAPT phases is left unchanged on
  purpose — a different, correct meaning.
- **Case-sensitive-filesystem bug in the workspace directory name.** When the
  runtime workspace was lowercased to `drydock/`, several path references were
  left as `Drydock/` — the `session-guard` hook's `SUITE_DIR`, the default
  workspace and prune-set in `aggregate-cost.py` / `verify-gate.py`, and the
  deterministic eval fixtures. On a case-insensitive filesystem (macOS) these
  still resolved, but on a case-sensitive one (Linux/CI) they pointed at a
  non-existent `Drydock/`, so the session-guard never fired and the helper
  scripts defaulted to the wrong directory. All workspace path references are now
  lowercase `drydock/`, matching what `bootstrap-workspace.sh` creates. This also
  fixes the deterministic eval suite, which was green on macOS but failing in CI.
- **Progressive-disclosure refactor** — the four oversized `SKILL.md` files were
  slimmed below the 500-line budget by deferring per-phase detail to on-demand
  `phases/` and `reference/` files (loaders + frontmatter stay in `SKILL.md`):
  `drydock` 1212→451 (5 new `phases/`+`reference/` files), `solution-architect`
  826→240 (6 phases), `qa-engineer` 670→376 (7 phases), `devops` 667→273 (6
  phases). Each slimmed `SKILL.md` gains a Phase/Reference Index and Dispatch
  Protocol, mirroring `software-engineer`. Lossless: no instruction was dropped,
  only relocated. Verified by the eval suite (loaders/frontmatter intact) and a
  live routing smoke test (orchestrator still loads with zero plugin errors and
  classifies correctly).

### Added
- **Gate-metric re-derivation** — the production-readiness gate no longer trusts
  the agents' self-reported receipt metrics. `skills/drydock/scripts/verify-gate.py`
  independently re-derives **tests** (from JUnit XML) and **coverage** (from
  Istanbul/Cobertura/lcov) from the build's ground-truth artifacts, verifies every
  claimed artifact exists, and flags any receipt whose numbers contradict the
  artifacts. `phases/gates.md` now gates on the derived values: a `mismatch`
  (overstated pass count / coverage) or a missing artifact is a BLOCKING breach;
  metrics with no parseable artifact fall back to the receipt tagged `[unverified]`.
- **Scripts over prose** — two deterministic orchestrator procedures that were
  described in prose are now bundled scripts the orchestrator runs directly:
  `skills/drydock/scripts/bootstrap-workspace.sh` (scaffold `drydock/` +
  deploy all shared protocols, with `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` → `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`
  → script-relative source resolution) and `skills/drydock/scripts/aggregate-cost.py`
  (sum effort/cost metrics across receipts, dedup artifacts, tolerate malformed
  receipts). The full-build setup, non-Full-Build mode bootstrap, and final-summary
  docs now call these instead of re-deriving them each run.

### Testing
- **Dangling-reference eval** — new `test_skill_file_refs.py` asserts every
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/*/(phases|reference|scripts)/*` and
  `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/...` file reference in any `SKILL.md` resolves to a file on
  disk, so a dangling dispatch/loader path fails CI (the bug class behind the
  `code-reviewer` fix above).
- **Gate re-derivation eval** — `test_gate_verification.py` drives `verify-gate.py`
  against fixtures: it CONFIRMS a truthful receipt (`verified`, `trustworthy`),
  CATCHES a lying one (tests/coverage `mismatch`, missing artifact flagged,
  `trustworthy: false`), and reports `unverified` when no artifact exists.
- **Bundled-script eval** — `test_drydock_scripts.py` runs both helper scripts
  against throwaway fixtures and asserts their behavior (protocols deployed,
  metrics aggregated/deduplicated), so a script regression fails CI for free.
- **SKILL.md size budget** — new deterministic test `test_skill_size.py` fails
  any `skills/*/SKILL.md` over 500 lines, locking in the progressive-disclosure
  win (`phases/`/`reference/` detail files are exempt).
- **Eval harness added** — a two-tier evaluation suite under `evals/`.
  - **Deterministic tier (free, gates every PR)** — pure-Python structural
    invariants over the repo, run by `evals/run_deterministic.py` and wired into
    CI via [`.github/workflows/evals.yml`](.github/workflows/evals.yml) (also
    `make evals`). No API key and no Claude CLI. Guards: loader-resolution shape
    (the belt-and-suspenders protocol fallback chain), dead-tool regression
    (`TeamCreate`/`TeamDelete`/`smart_outline`/`smart_search`/`smart_unfold`
    never reappear as live calls), agent/skill cross-reference (the 11
    `agents/*.md` map 1:1 to worker skills; the 4 main-context skills have no
    agent file), manifest integrity (`plugin.json`/`marketplace.json` version
    agreement), and YAML frontmatter validity.
  - **Behavioral tier (local-only)** — non-deterministic routing checks driven
    by `claude -p` (`make evals-behavioral`). Uses your local Claude Code login
    and spends usage; intentionally **NOT** in CI (no API key, `temperature=1.0`
    is non-deterministic).
- Version bumped to **2.2.0** in `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` for the
  rename and the autonomy-level terminology (user-facing naming changes); the
  documentation, eval, and audit-fix work ships in the same release.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-25

Dispatch-port + correctness release. The orchestration is now built entirely on documented Claude Code primitives — **not** breaking; these are internal dispatch and correctness fixes with no change to the public contract or generated-artifact behavior.

### Changed
- **Ported orchestration to documented primitives** — the 15 agents are now real `agents/` subagent definitions (auto-discovered, with isolation/background frontmatter) dispatched as genuine isolated subagents via the real `Task*` tools.
- **Removed nonexistent tooling** — dropped references to the made-up `TeamCreate`/`TeamDelete` and `smart_outline`/`smart_search`/`smart_unfold` tools that were never real Claude Code tools; the real `Task*` tools are retained.
- **First-run protocol loader fixed** — the first-run-empty bug in the protocol loader is fixed with a belt-and-suspenders `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` / `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` path resolution.
- **Scoped allowed-tools** — each worker subagent now declares a scoped `allowed-tools` set instead of inheriting the full toolset.
- **skill-maker corrected** — updated to SOTA skill-authoring rules.

### Fixed
- **Hooks hardened** — `SessionStart`/`PreToolUse` hook commands no longer guess a non-versioned `~/.claude/plugins/cache` path; when `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is unset they fail loudly to stderr and exit 0 so the session is never blocked.

### Removed
- **Dead config** — deleted the orphaned `skills/drydock/hooks/activation-rules.json` (referenced a `UserPromptSubmit` hook wired to nothing).

### CI
- **Strict validation** — CI installs the Claude Code CLI (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`) and runs `claude plugin validate . --strict`, failing the job on any error or warning (no more warning swallow, and no more hard-fail when the CLI is simply absent on the runner). It also verifies `skills/*/SKILL.md` + `agents/*.md` frontmatter with a real YAML parse (name present; description present and ≤1024 chars).
- **Marketplace description added** — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` now carries a top-level `description`, which `--strict` requires (the previous warning was promoted to an error under strict mode).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-25

Enterprise-grade hardening release. Drydock now treats production-readiness as evidence-backed and enforceable: artifacts are generated (not described) and blocking gates verify them.

### Added
- **Four new shared protocols**, deployed to `drydock/.protocols/` at orchestrator bootstrap and loaded by the worker skills: `security-defaults.md` (security-by-default baseline), `observability-contract.md` (OTel traces/metrics/logs + RED/USE), `architecture-boundaries.md` (Clean Architecture / dependency-rule enforcement), and `compliance-protocol.md` (per-product regulatory mapping). These join `grounding-protocol.md` and `security-testing-protocol.md`.
- **Compliance Officer skill** (`drydock:compliance-officer`) — the 15th agent. Scopes per-product regulatory frameworks (SOC 2, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS v4.0.1, CCPA/CPRA, ISO 27001, FedRAMP), maps mandatory controls to implementing artifacts, verifies controls exist in generated code/infra, and emits statutory evidence (SSP, DPIA, breach runbook) behind a blocking compliance gate.
- **Compliance execution mode** — new orchestrator mode (now 12 total), invocable for regulated builds and as a gate input to production-readiness.
- **Real secret-guard hook** — `hooks/secret-guard.sh`, wired as a `PreToolUse` hook in `hooks/hooks.json`. Blocks committing/writing secret files and scans staged diffs for credentials.
- **Generated observability** — OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs scaffolding plus RED (Rate/Errors/Duration) and USE (Utilization/Saturation/Errors) metric sets, produced as real artifacts.
- **OpenFeature feature flags** — standardized flag provider with an env-var fallback.
- **OpenAPI governance** — API-first contract linting and spec-as-source enforcement.
- **Supply-chain hardening** — GitHub Actions CI templates (lint-clean by default), SLSA provenance, and cosign artifact signing.
- **Unified blocking gate metrics** — downstream skills now emit `tests_passing`, `tests_failing`, `coverage_lines`, `coverage_branches`, `mutation_score`, `patch_coverage`, `contract_can_i_deploy`, `perf_baseline_regression`, and a compliance controls-present/missing status.

### Changed
- **Unified blocking production-readiness gate** — `production-ready` is now BLOCKED on failing tests, coverage, performance budget, compliance controls, or architecture-boundary violations. An explicit, logged "accepted with justification" override receipt is the only escape hatch.
- **Mutation + property tests default-on** — QA emits mutation score and property-based coverage as first-class gate metrics.
- **CI/CD defaults to GitHub Actions templates** for the generated pipeline and supply-chain steps.
- **Plugin metadata** — version 2.0.0; description, keywords, author email, homepage, and repository updated to advertise the 15-agent enterprise roster.

### Breaking
- **Default error format is now RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`.** Services and clients that assumed the prior ad-hoc error envelope must migrate to the problem+json shape. This is potentially breaking for existing integrations.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-24

### Added
- **Grounding & Anti-Hallucination protocol** — new shared protocol `grounding-protocol.md`, loaded by all 14 agents. Evidence-first generation: every factual/code claim cites `file:line`, command output, or a retrieved source; claim↔evidence separation; `[verified]`/`[inferred]`/`[unverified]` confidence tags; cite-or-abstain; a 4-step chain-of-verification; and security-specific no-fabrication (never invent CVE ids or CVSS scores).
- **Security Testing Authorization & Safety protocol** — new shared protocol `security-testing-protocol.md`, loaded by the Security Engineer. Mandatory authorization + scope gate before any active testing; local/authorized-staging targets only; no DoS/destructive payloads/production data; responsible disclosure; evidence-backed findings; CVSS discipline (4.0 primary, 3.1 ingested, paired with EPSS/CISA KEV).
- **Real VAPT execution** — two new Security Engineer phases. `07-vapt-execution.md` runs gated DAST/pen-testing (recon→enum→scan→exploit/PoC→retest) with a 24-tool integration table (semgrep, CodeQL, trivy, grype, osv-scanner, gitleaks, trufflehog, checkov, OWASP ZAP, nuclei, nikto, sqlmap, wapiti, ffuf, schemathesis, RESTler…), each with verified invocations and safe-by-default usage; all active/DAST tools are gated behind the authorization step. `08-vapt-report.md` assembles a professional CVSS-backed pentest report. The Security Engineer now runs 8 phases.
- **Pentest (VAPT) execution mode** — new orchestrator mode with a mandatory authorization-gate prompt before any active testing, plus `/drydock pentest` and `/drydock vapt` commands. HARDEN mode remains static-only so the gate cannot be bypassed.

### Changed
- **OWASP coverage** — Security Engineer audits against OWASP Top 10 2025, API Security Top 10 (2023), and the LLM Top 10 (2025), with a Standards References section and a per-finding standards tag block (CVSS 4.0 / CWE / OWASP / WSTG v4.2 / ASVS 5.0.0). Verified against official sources.
- **Plugin metadata** — version 1.1.0; description and keywords advertise VAPT + OWASP coverage and anti-hallucination guardrails.
