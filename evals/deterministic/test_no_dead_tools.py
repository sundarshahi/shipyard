"""Guard against regressing to nonexistent ("dead") tooling.

Drydock once referenced tools that have since been removed from the harness:
TeamCreate, TeamDelete, smart_outline, smart_search, smart_unfold. If any
skill/agent prose starts *calling* these again (or treats them as live), the
orchestrator will silently emit instructions the runtime cannot honor — a
class of bug that is invisible in review but breaks at execution time.

This test scans every *.md under skills/ and agents/ and fails if a dead token
appears as a CALL (token immediately followed by "(") OR appears bare on a line
that carries no removal/negation marker. A bare mention is only benign when it
is BOTH (a) not a call-form AND (b) accompanied by a negation marker on the same
line — e.g. the documented "TeamCreate/TeamDelete no longer exist" note in
skills/drydock/SKILL.md. We positively assert that benign line passes through,
so the heuristic itself is proven, not just assumed.
