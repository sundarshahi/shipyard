# Drydock — Personal Dev Plugin for Claude Code

**15 orchestrated skills. 12 execution modes. Idea to production.**

Drydock is a set of orchestrated skills (each shows up as a `drydock:<skill>` invocation) coordinated by a single orchestrator. Throughout these docs "agent" and "skill" refer to the same thing: a specialized worker the orchestrator routes to.

## Install (marketplace)

Install Drydock from inside Claude Code using the plugin marketplace flow:

```text
/plugin marketplace add sundarshahi/drydock
/plugin install drydock
```

This pulls the published plugin and registers its skills, hooks, and shared protocols. No local clone required.

**Requirements:** Claude Code, Docker & Docker Compose, Git.

## Install (dev / local clone)

For local development or to run an unreleased checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sundarshahi/drydock ~/.claude/plugins/drydock
claude --plugin-dir ~/.claude/plugins/drydock
```

## Enterprise-grade by default

Every dimension below is **evidence-backed** — Drydock generates real artifacts and enforces blocking gates, not prose recommendations.

- **12-Factor** — config from environment, stateless processes, and disposability are scaffolded and checked, not assumed.
- **Clean Architecture** — the dependency rule is enforced by the `architecture-boundaries` protocol; boundary violations block `production-ready`.
- **API-first** — OpenAPI specs are the source of truth; contracts are linted and `can-i-deploy` is a gate input.
- **Observability** — generated OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs plus RED/USE metric sets, wired to an OTLP endpoint.
- **Security-by-default** — the `security-defaults` protocol plus a real `secret-guard` hook that blocks secret writes/commits and scans staged diffs.
- **CI/CD + supply-chain** — lint-clean GitHub Actions templates with SLSA provenance and cosign artifact signing.
- **Automated testing** — unit/integration plus mutation and property-based tests default-on; coverage and mutation score are gate metrics.
- **Performance budgets** — budgets defined in `docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml`; baseline regression blocks the readiness gate.
- **Feature flags** — OpenFeature provider with an env-var fallback, generated into the runtime.
- **Developer experience (DX)** — consistent tooling, scaffolds, and runbooks so the generated project is pleasant to extend.
- **Per-product regulatory compliance** — the Compliance Officer maps SOC 2 / GDPR / HIPAA / PCI-DSS controls to artifacts; missing controls block the gate.
- **Anti-hallucination grounding** — evidence-first generation: every claim cites `file:line`, command output, or a retrieved source.

Errors follow **RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`** by default. `production-ready` is **blocked** on failing tests, coverage, performance budget, compliance controls, or architecture-boundary violations — overridable only with a logged "accepted with justification" receipt.

## The 15 Skills

These are orchestrated skills — each is invocable as `drydock:<skill>` and the orchestrator routes to them based on your request.

| # | Skill | Sole Authority |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Orchestrator | Routes, gates, receipts |
| 2 | Polymath | Research, ideation, translation |
| 3 | Product Manager | Requirements |
| 4 | Solution Architect | Architecture |
| 5 | Software Engineer | Backend |
| 6 | Frontend Engineer | UI/UX |
| 7 | QA Engineer | Tests |
| 8 | Security Engineer | Security + VAPT |
| 9 | Code Reviewer | Code Quality |

## Key Behaviors

- **Receipt enforcement** — every agent writes JSON proof; gates verify before opening
- **Re-anchoring** — specs re-read from disk at every phase transition (no context drift)
- **Adversarial review** — code reviewer assumes code is wrong until proven right
- **Grounding / anti-hallucination** — evidence-first: every claim cites `file:line`, command output, or a retrieved source; `[verified]`/`[inferred]`/`[unverified]` confidence tags; cite-or-abstain; never invents CVEs/CVSS
- **VAPT authorization gate** — active/DAST testing only against explicitly authorized, local/staging targets; no DoS/destructive payloads; responsible disclosure
- **Freshness protocol** — agents WebSearch volatile data (model IDs, CVEs) before implementing
- **Boundary safety** — 6 structural patterns for system boundary bugs
- **Worktree isolation** — parallel agents each get their own git worktree (zero file conflicts)

## Engagement Modes

| Mode | Questions | Use When |
|---|---|---|
| Express | Zero (3 gates only) | Speed matters, trust the pipeline |
| Standard | 1-2 per skill | Best default balance |
| Thorough | All major decisions | Complex or high-stakes builds |
| Meticulous | Every decision | Full control, maximum oversight |
