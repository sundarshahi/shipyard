## Authority Boundaries

- **devops** owns infrastructure provisioning, CI/CD, monitoring setup — does NOT define SLOs
- **sre** owns SLO/SLI definitions, error budgets, runbooks, chaos engineering — does NOT provision infrastructure
- See `Shipyard/.protocols/conflict-resolution.md`

## Re-Anchor

Before creating SHIP tasks, re-read key artifacts from disk:
- `Shipyard/security-engineer/findings/` (security findings for remediation)
- `Shipyard/code-reviewer/findings/critical.md`, `high.md` (including HIGH architecture-boundary violations)
- `Shipyard/compliance-officer/` control-evidence map (missing mandatory controls)
- `Shipyard/qa-engineer/` results (failing tests, sub-threshold coverage, perf regression)
- `Shipyard/solution-architect/system-design.md` (architecture for infra)
- Directory listing of `services/`, `infrastructure/` (what exists)
- All HARDEN receipts from `.orchestrator/receipts/` (T5, T6a, T6b, Tcomp) — including their gate/metric fields

Use this freshly-read data when writing the delegation context below.

## PARALLEL #5: T7 + T8

Read `Shipyard/.orchestrator/settings.md` to check if `Worktrees: enabled`. Worktree isolation lives in each subagent's definition frontmatter (`isolation: worktree`); if worktrees are disabled in settings, note that the merge-back step below is skipped.

Delegate the following to their subagents to run CONCURRENTLY (each is backgrounded + isolated in its own worktree per its definition):

- **`devops` -> T7 (DevOps IaC + CI/CD).**
  `TaskUpdate(taskId=t7_id, status="in_progress")`, then delegate to the `devops` subagent (agents/devops.md — runs backgrounded in its own worktree per its definition).
  Task context:
  - Read architecture: docs/architecture/
  - Read implementation: services/, frontend/
  - Read .shipyard.yaml for paths and preferences.
  - Read protocols from: Shipyard/.protocols/
  - Generate: Terraform/Pulumi, K8s manifests (if microservices), CI/CD pipelines, monitoring dashboards.
  - Write to project root: infrastructure/, .github/workflows/
  - Write workspace artifacts to: Shipyard/devops/
  - DO NOT define SLOs — add placeholder: "SLO thresholds defined by SRE."
  - DO NOT write runbooks — SRE writes runbooks to docs/runbooks/.
  - Generate GitHub Actions workflow templates first for CI/CD. Embed in CI the SAME scanners the BUILD-EXIT security gate ran (osv-scanner/npm audit, gitleaks, semgrep --config auto) so CI enforces exactly what BUILD enforced.
  - HARD PIPELINE LINT (this is a blocking gate, not advisory). Run and capture results:
    - actionlint on every .github/workflows/*.yml
    - hadolint on every Dockerfile
    - tflint AND terraform validate on all Terraform/IaC (run terraform init -backend=false first as needed)
    Any error from actionlint, hadolint, tflint, or terraform validate FAILS the T7 receipt — set status: failed, do NOT mark the task completed, self-debug and re-run until clean (or escalate after retries).
  - When complete, write a receipt JSON to Shipyard/.orchestrator/receipts/T7-devops.json with task, agent, phase, status, artifacts, metrics, effort, verification. The verification block MUST record the lint result per tool (actionlint, hadolint, tflint, terraform validate) as pass/fail with error counts — a non-clean lint means status: failed. Then mark task T7 as completed.

- **`software-engineer` -> T8 (Remediation — fix HARDEN findings).**
  `TaskUpdate(taskId=t8_id, status="in_progress")`, then delegate to the `software-engineer` subagent (agents/software-engineer.md — runs backgrounded in its own worktree per its definition).
  Task context:
  - Read HARDEN findings from workspace: Shipyard/security-engineer/, code-reviewer/, qa-engineer/, compliance-officer/
  - Fix the full BLOCKING set from HARDEN (not just security): security Critical/High, ANY failing test, sub-threshold coverage/patch-coverage, p95/error-rate perf regression beyond tolerance, every MISSING mandatory compliance control, and every HIGH architecture-boundary violation. Lower-severity / non-mandatory items are documented, not fixed here.
  - For each finding: (1) Read the affected file, (2) Apply the fix, (3) Run affected tests to verify no regressions, (4) Re-scan the affected code.
  - If findings persist after 2 fix-rescan cycles → document and escalate.
  - Medium/Low findings: document but do not block.
  - When complete, write a receipt JSON to Shipyard/.orchestrator/receipts/T8-remediation.json with task, agent, phase, status, artifacts (files modified), metrics (findings_fixed, findings_remaining), effort, verification. Then mark task T8 as completed.

Track both: the two `TaskUpdate(... status="in_progress")` calls above stay; mark each task completed via its receipt as the subagents finish.

## PARALLEL #6: T9 + T10 (after T7 + T8 complete)

T10 is conditional — auto-detect LLM/ML usage first: use Grep to scan imports for `openai`, `anthropic`, `langchain`, `transformers`, `torch`, `tensorflow` (Glob to find the source files to scan). T10 runs only if a match is detected OR `features.ai_ml` is true; otherwise skip it with `TaskUpdate(taskId=t10_id, status="completed")`.

Delegate the following to their subagents to run CONCURRENTLY (each is backgrounded + isolated in its own worktree per its definition):

- **`sre` -> T9 (Production Readiness — SOLE SLO AUTHORITY).**
  `TaskUpdate(taskId=t9_id, status="in_progress")`, then delegate to the `sre` subagent (agents/sre.md — runs backgrounded in its own worktree per its definition). The `sre` subagent is the SOLE authority on SLO definitions, error budgets, runbooks, and capacity planning.
  Task context:
  - Read all prior outputs: architecture, implementation, infrastructure, HARDEN findings.
  - Read protocols from: Shipyard/.protocols/
  - Perform production readiness review (checklist).
  - Define SLIs/SLOs per service, error budgets, burn-rate alerts.
  - Design chaos engineering scenarios and game-day playbook.
  - Write runbooks to project root: docs/runbooks/
  - Write workspace artifacts to: Shipyard/sre/
  - When complete, write a receipt JSON to Shipyard/.orchestrator/receipts/T9-sre.json with task, agent, phase, status, artifacts, metrics, effort, verification. Then mark task T9 as completed.

- **`data-scientist` -> T10 (only if LLM/ML usage detected — see above).**
  `TaskUpdate(taskId=t10_id, status="in_progress")`, then delegate to the `data-scientist` subagent (agents/data-scientist.md — runs backgrounded in its own worktree per its definition).
  Task context:
  - Read implementation for LLM/ML usage patterns (imports, API calls, prompts).
  - Read protocols from: Shipyard/.protocols/
  - Optimize: prompt engineering, token usage, semantic caching, fallback chains.
  - Design: A/B testing infrastructure, experiment framework, data pipeline.
  - Write workspace artifacts to: Shipyard/data-scientist/
  - When complete, write a receipt JSON to Shipyard/.orchestrator/receipts/T10-data-scientist.json with task, agent, phase, status, artifacts, metrics, effort, verification. Then mark task T10 as completed.

Track both: the `TaskUpdate(... status="in_progress")` calls above stay; mark each task completed via its receipt as the subagents finish.

## Worktree Merge-Back

Subagents with `isolation: worktree` edit an isolated branch that must be merged back. If worktrees were used, merge each SHIP subagent's worktree branch back after each parallel pair completes:

```python
# After PARALLEL #5 (T7 + T8) — merge the devops/software-engineer subagent worktree branches:
for branch in ship_p5_worktree_branches:
  Bash(f"git merge --no-ff {branch} -m 'shipyard: merge {branch}'")
  Bash(f"git branch -d {branch}")

# After PARALLEL #6 (T9 + T10) — merge the sre/data-scientist subagent worktree branches:
for branch in ship_p6_worktree_branches:
  Bash(f"git merge --no-ff {branch} -m 'shipyard: merge {branch}'")
  Bash(f"git branch -d {branch}")
# If merge conflicts: git merge --abort, escalate to user
```

## Receipt Verification Before Gate 3

After T9 (and T10 if applicable) completes:
1. **Verify all SHIP receipts:** Read `.orchestrator/receipts/T7-devops.json`, `T8-remediation.json`, `T9-sre.json`, `T10-data-scientist.json` (if applicable). Verify all listed artifacts exist. Confirm the T7 receipt records a CLEAN hard pipeline lint (actionlint/hadolint/tflint/terraform validate) — a failed lint blocks Gate 3.
2. **Verify remediation chain:** For each BLOCKING finding from HARDEN (security Critical/High, failing test, sub-threshold coverage, perf regression, missing mandatory compliance control, HIGH architecture-boundary violation), check that a remediation receipt AND a verification receipt exist. If any blocking finding lacks verification, flag before Gate 3.
3. **Aggregate metrics** from all receipts for Gate 3 display — use verified receipt data, not memory. Include the gate fields: `tests_passing`/`tests_failing`, `coverage_lines`/`coverage_branches`, `mutation_score`, `patch_coverage`, `contract_can_i_deploy`, `perf_baseline_regression`, and the compliance controls-present/missing status.
4. **'production-ready' is BLOCKED** while any blocking gate is open — failing tests, coverage/patch-coverage below threshold, perf-budget regression, missing mandatory compliance control, or HIGH architecture-boundary violation. Gate 3 may only present "production-ready" when all blocking gates are clear OR each open item carries a logged "accepted with justification" override receipt.

## Gate 3 — Production Readiness

After verification, present Gate 3 using the orchestrator's gate pattern.

On approval → read `phases/sustain.md` and begin SUSTAIN phase.
On "Fix issues first" → create additional remediation tasks.
