"""verify-gate.py — independently RE-DERIVE Gate 3 metrics from ground-truth
artifacts instead of trusting the agents' self-reported receipt numbers.

WHY: each worker writes its own `metrics` into its receipt (tests_passing,
coverage_lines, ...). The production-readiness gate previously trusted those
values verbatim. A buggy or optimistic agent could report green while the real
test/coverage artifacts say otherwise. This script reads the actual artifacts
the build produced and reports DERIVED metrics next to the CLAIMED ones, so the
orchestrator can gate on ground truth and treat any mismatch as a breach.

Re-derives:
  - tests   from JUnit XML report(s)            (pytest/jest/go/surefire/... all emit this)
  - coverage from Istanbul coverage-summary.json, Cobertura coverage.xml, or lcov.info
Also verifies every receipt's claimed `artifacts` exist on disk.

Anything it cannot find a parseable artifact for is reported status="unverified"
(the orchestrator falls back to the receipt value and flags it), NOT silently
passed.

Usage:
  python3 verify-gate.py [WORKSPACE_DIR] [PROJECT_ROOT]
    WORKSPACE_DIR  default: Shipyard
    PROJECT_ROOT   default: .   (where tests/coverage artifacts live)

Emits a JSON verdict to stdout. Exit code is always 0 (it reports, it does not
gate — the orchestrator decides); parse the JSON.
