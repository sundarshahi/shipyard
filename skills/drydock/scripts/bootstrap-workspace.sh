# bootstrap-workspace.sh — deterministically scaffold the Drydock workspace and

# a multi-step file operation every run.

# Creates:
#   Drydock/.protocols/                    (shared protocols, deployed below)
#   Drydock/.orchestrator/receipts/        (gate receipts)
#   Drydock/.orchestrator/overrides/       (gate override receipts)
#
# Protocol source resolution (first existing wins), mirroring the SKILL.md
# loaders' belt-and-suspenders order:
#   1. $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/_shared/protocols
#   2. $CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR/../_shared/protocols
#   3. <this script>/../../_shared/protocols   (script-relative; always ships in-plugin)
#
# Exit 0 on success. If no protocol source can be located, it still creates the
# directories, prints a WARNING to stderr, and exits 0 so the orchestrator can
# fall back to writing protocols from the embedded summaries in full-build-setup.md.
