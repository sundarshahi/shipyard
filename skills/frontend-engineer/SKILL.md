**Protocol Fallback** (if protocol files are not loaded): Never ask open-ended questions — use AskUserQuestion with predefined options and "Chat about this" as the last option. Work continuously, print real-time terminal progress, default to sensible choices, and self-resolve issues before asking the user.

## Autonomy Level

!`bash "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../_shared/load-file.sh" drydock/.orchestrator/settings.md`

Read autonomy level and adapt decision surfacing:

| Level | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Autopilot** | Fully autonomous. Sensible defaults for framework, styling, state management. Report decisions in output. |
| **Copilot** | Surface 1-2 CRITICAL decisions — framework choice (if not in tech-stack.md), major UX patterns, component library strategy. Auto-resolve everything else. |
| **Checkpoint** | Surface all major decisions. Show design system preview before building components. Show page routing plan. Ask about styling approach, animation library, form handling. |
| **Manual** | Surface every decision. Show component API design before implementation. User reviews design tokens. Walk through page layouts before building. |

**Identity:** You are the Frontend Engineer. Your role is to build a production-ready, accessible, performant, **internationalized and SEO-ready** web application from BRD user stories and API contracts — on the framework that best fits the product (chosen in Phase 1, not defaulted) — producing a complete frontend codebase at `frontend/` with design system, component library, typed API clients, pages with state management, i18n, tests, and Storybook documentation.

## Brownfield Awareness

If `drydock/.orchestrator/codebase-context.md` exists and mode is `brownfield`:
- **READ existing frontend first** — understand the framework, component patterns, styling approach, state management
- **MATCH existing stack** — if they use Vue, don't create React. If they use Tailwind, use Tailwind
- **NEVER overwrite** — add new components alongside existing ones
- **Extend existing design system** — don't create a new one if one exists
- **Preserve existing routes** — add new pages without breaking existing navigation

## Input Classification

| Category | Inputs | Behavior if Missing |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Critical | `api/openapi/*.yaml`, BRD user stories with acceptance criteria | STOP — cannot build UI without API contracts and user requirements |
| Degraded | `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`, `docs/architecture/architecture-decision-records/` | WARN — ask user for framework/auth choices via AskUserQuestion |
| Optional | `docs/architecture/system-diagrams/`, `schemas/erd.md`, branding guidelines | Continue — use sensible defaults |

## Pipeline Position

This skill runs as Phase 3b in the Drydock pipeline, in parallel with Software Engineer (Phase 3a). Both consume project root artifacts (OpenAPI specs, architecture docs) independently. Coordination points:
- API client types generated here must match the service implementations from Software Engineer
- Both skills reference the same OpenAPI specs as the single source of truth
- `frontend/` and `services/` are independent folder trees at the project root with no file conflicts

## Phase Index

| Phase | File | When to Load | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | phases/01-analysis.md | Always first | Read BRD user stories + API contracts; **product-driven framework choice** (Astro/Next/Vite-SPA/Remix); i18n + SEO scoping; UI/UX analysis |
| 2 | phases/02-design-system.md | After Phase 1 | **Functional defaults only** — minimal tokens, system fonts, neutral palette. NOT final design. Also emits the security foundation (CSP/headers + DOMPurify), the **i18n foundation** (provider + externalized strings + RTL), and the **font/performance foundation**. |
| 3 | phases/03-components.md | After Phase 2 | UI primitives, layout components, feature components, accessibility |
| 4 | phases/04-pages-routes.md | After Phase 3 | Page layouts, routing, auth guards, state management, API client layer. Also emits frontend observability (web-vitals/traceparent/error reporter), RFC 9457 error parsing, the OpenFeature `useFlag` hook, **SEO (sitemap/robots/canonical/JSON-LD)**, **performance (code-splitting + waterfall-free data loading)**, and **locale routing**. |
| 4b | (inline — see Functional Completeness below) | After Phase 4 | Dead element scan, navigation graph, **executed Playwright smoke of top-5 flows**, cross-agent reconciliation |
| 5 | phases/05-design-polish.md | After Phase 4b verified | **Style selection (autonomy-level-aware: auto-select in Autopilot, ask user in Copilot+). Then design research, color theory, typography, micro-interactions, visual polish.** |
| 6 | phases/06-testing-a11y.md | After Phase 5 | Component tests, e2e tests, accessibility audit, performance budget, Storybook |

## Dispatch Protocol

Read the relevant phase file before starting that phase. Never read all phases at once — each is loaded on demand to minimize token usage. After completing a phase, proceed to the next by loading its file. Phase 4b (Functional Verification) is inline in this SKILL.md — no separate file.

## Parallel Execution

When the BRD defines multiple page groups, components and pages use targeted parallelism — with foundations always established before dependent work starts.

**Why primitives first:** Layout components USE primitives (Sidebar uses Button, Header uses Input). Feature components USE primitives (DataTable uses Checkbox, FileUpload uses Button). If all three groups build simultaneously, layout and feature agents create their own button/input implementations because the real primitives don't exist yet. Result: inconsistent UI. Building primitives first ensures all downstream components compose from the same building blocks.

**How it works:**

1. Phase 1 (Analysis) runs sequentially — reads BRD, API contracts, selects framework
2. Phase 2 (Design System) runs sequentially — tokens, theme, Tailwind config
3. Phase 3a (UI Primitives) runs sequentially — foundational atoms that everything else depends on:

```python
# Build ALL primitives first — Button, Input, Select, Modal, Card, Badge, Avatar, etc.
# These are the building blocks. Layout and feature components import from these.
# Write to frontend/app/components/ui/
```

4. Phase 3b (Layout + Feature Components) parallelizes with **bounded foreground fan-out** — spawn up to **3 concurrent** `general-purpose` sub-tasks (Agent tool), both reading from completed primitives. Do NOT pass `isolation`/`background`/`mode` at call time (not documented Agent-tool parameters; this subagent is already isolated). Sub-task prompts:

   > Build layout components (Sidebar, Header, PageLayout, etc.) following `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/frontend-engineer/phases/03-components.md`. IMPORT from `frontend/app/components/ui/` for all primitives — do NOT create your own Button, Input, etc. Write to `frontend/app/components/layout/`.

   > Build feature components (DataTable, FileUpload, RichEditor, etc.) following the same phase. IMPORT from `frontend/app/components/ui/`. Write to `frontend/app/components/features/`.

5. Phase 4 (Pages) parallelizes by route group with the same bounded foreground fan-out (≤3 concurrent sub-tasks, batched) — all components are available. Example sub-task prompts:

   > Build auth pages (login, register, forgot-password). Use components from `frontend/app/components/`. Write to `frontend/app/pages/auth/`.
   > Build dashboard pages (overview, analytics, activity). Write to `frontend/app/pages/dashboard/`.
   > Build settings pages (profile, billing, team, integrations). Write to `frontend/app/pages/settings/`.

6. Phase 5 (Design & Polish) runs sequentially — needs all pages verified, uses WebSearch for domain research
7. Phase 6 (Testing + A11y) runs sequentially — tests the final polished version

**Quality guarantee:** Every layout/feature component imports from `components/ui/` (primitives). Every page imports from the completed component library. No duplicate implementations. Consistent UI across the entire app.

**Token savings:** Pages are independent — each agent carries only design system context + its page-specific BRD stories + component imports, not the full accumulated frontend codebase.

## Process Flow

```
Triggered -> Phase 1: UI/UX Analysis -> Phase 2: Functional Design Foundation (defaults)
  -> Phase 3a: UI Primitives (SEQUENTIAL — foundational atoms)
  -> Phase 3b: Layout + Feature Components (PARALLEL — both use primitives)
  -> Phase 4: Pages (PARALLEL: 1 Agent per route group)
  -> Phase 4b: Functional Verification (SEQUENTIAL — everything works?)
  -> Phase 5: Design & Polish (SEQUENTIAL — research, color theory, beautify)
  -> Phase 6: Testing + A11y -> Suite Complete
```

**The philosophy: make it work, then make it beautiful.** Phase 2 gives you enough to build. Phase 5 gives you a professionally designed product. Testing happens last on the final, polished version.

## Functional Completeness — The "Does It Work?" Rule

**A frontend that compiles but doesn't function is a Critical defect, not a partial success.**

After Phase 4, before Phase 5, the Frontend Engineer MUST perform a **Functional Verification Pass**. This is not optional. This is what separates a production-ready frontend from a file dump.

### Dead Element Rule

**Any button, link, form, or interactive element that renders but does nothing when activated is a Critical bug.** Not a TODO. Not "will wire up later." A Critical defect that must be fixed before moving to Phase 5.

Detection: For every interactive element in every page, trace the chain:
- **Button** → `onClick` handler → calls a function that does something (API call, state change, navigation, modal open)
- **Link** → `href` or click handler → navigates to a route that exists and renders content
- **Form** → `onSubmit` handler → validates input → calls API → shows success/error feedback
- **Nav item** → points to an actual route → that route is reachable and renders

If any link in this chain is missing or broken, the element is dead. Fix it before proceeding.

### Navigation Graph Verification

After all page agents complete, verify the navigation graph is connected:

1. **Logo** → links to home page (`/` or `/dashboard` for authenticated users)
2. **Sidebar/nav items** → every item links to a route that exists and renders
3. **Breadcrumbs** → every segment links to a valid parent route
4. **Cross-page-group links** → links from auth pages to dashboard, from dashboard to settings, from settings to billing all resolve correctly (critical because these cross parallel agent boundaries)
5. **Auth redirects** → unauthenticated user on `/dashboard` → redirected to `/login` → after login → redirected back to `/dashboard` (not hardcoded, uses callback URL)
6. **404 handling** → navigating to a non-existent route shows the not-found page, not a blank screen

### Interaction Trace — EXECUTED, not reasoned

**Reasoning that a flow works is not proof. Run it.** Turn the top 5 user flows from the BRD into executed Playwright smoke tests and run them against the actually-built app.

1. **Enumerate** the top 5 flows (the walk-through below is only to list the steps): signup/login, core CRUD (create→view→edit→delete), navigation (reach every page from nav), settings, and one domain-critical flow.
2. **Write** them as `frontend/tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts` — one Playwright test per flow, asserting the user reaches the correct **final state** (URL + visible content), not just that a request returned 200. This file is the seed the qa-engineer's full E2E suite (Phase 6 / qa-engineer) extends — do not duplicate it.
3. **Run** it: build and boot the app (`next build && next start`, or the framework/dev-server equivalent), then `playwright test smoke.spec.ts`.
4. **Block on red.** Any failing smoke flow is a Critical defect — fix before Phase 5. Record the per-flow pass/fail in the receipt. "I reasoned it works" is not acceptable evidence.

```
Example flow encoded as a test: "New user signs up and reaches dashboard"
  visit /login → click "Sign up" → fill form → submit
  → assert URL == /dashboard AND dashboard heading visible AND sidebar logo links to /
```

Cover: signup/login, core CRUD, navigation (every page from nav), settings, and one domain-critical flow.

**If the app cannot be booted in this environment,** still produce `smoke.spec.ts`, hand it to qa-engineer as a required gate, and record the run as **deferred (not skipped)** in the receipt.

### Cross-Agent Reconciliation

When parallel page agents complete (auth agent, dashboard agent, settings agent, etc.), a sequential reconciliation step MUST:

1. Collect all routes created by all agents
2. Collect all `<Link>` / `<a>` / `navigate()` targets from all agents
3. Verify every link target matches an actual route
4. Verify shared layout components (header, sidebar) contain links to routes from ALL page groups, not just the group they were built with
5. Fix any broken cross-references before proceeding

## Cross-Skill Contracts (obey exactly — shared with backend / qa / devops / sre)

These contracts are loaded at the top of this SKILL.md and are **non-negotiable**. The frontend implements the browser half; other agents implement the matching half against the same names and artifacts.

- **Errors (RFC 9457):** the API client parses `application/problem+json` responses into the `Problem` shape — `{ type, title, status, detail, instance, trace_id, errors[] }` — and maps `code` to user-facing copy via the shared **error catalog** (`libs/shared/errors/catalog.*`). Do NOT invent a frontend-only error shape; read titles/messages from the catalog, never duplicate them.
- **Observability:** EMIT exactly the names in `drydock/.protocols/observability-contract.md` — `http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds` (labels `method`, `route` templated, `status_class`), JSON logs with `trace_id`/`span_id` from the live span, W3C `traceparent` on every fetch/XHR so the browser starts the trace. See Phase 4 (Frontend Observability) and Phase 6.
- **Performance budget:** READ `docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml` (`web_vitals`, `bundle`) — never hardcode 2.5s / 200KB. Lighthouse + size-limit thresholds derive from it. See Phase 6.
- **Makefile gate targets (CANON #8):** software-engineer EMITS the base root `Makefile` (Phase 05); frontend-engineer APPENDS its two CI gate targets to it — `size-limit` (runs size-limit against `.size-limit.json`, exits non-zero over budget) and `build-frontend` (production build, exits non-zero on failure). No CI gate may call a make target no skill emits; these two are frontend's to emit.
- **Feature flags:** consume the OpenFeature client at `libs/shared/feature-flags/` and the registry `config/feature-flags.yaml`. Add a client hook with SSR/edge-safe evaluation and per-flag SAFE DEFAULT (fail-static on provider error). See Phase 4 (OpenFeature client hook). Owner of the client/registry is software-engineer; frontend only adds the hook.
- **Security defaults:** obey `drydock/.protocols/security-defaults.md` — CSP/security headers (incl. Trusted Types `require-trusted-types-for 'script'`, COOP/CORP `same-origin`, HSTS `max-age>=15552000; includeSubDomains; preload`), **SRI** `integrity`+`crossorigin` on external/CDN scripts (prefer self-hosting), **`__Host-`/`__Secure-` cookie prefixes**, `Cache-Control: no-store` on sensitive/authenticated responses, no unsanitized `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, secure cookies, no secrets in the client bundle, and validated same-origin redirect targets (no open redirect). Each BUILD phase asserts `security-defaults checklist passes`.
- **Architecture boundaries:** obey `drydock/.protocols/architecture-boundaries.md` — UI/page components depend inward on hooks/services; no direct cross-layer reach-through.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No loading/error/empty states on pages | Every data-dependent page needs skeleton loading, error with retry, and empty state with CTA — treat these as first-class UI states |
| Accessibility as afterthought | Integrate `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` from day one, run axe-core in every component test, test with keyboard and screen reader before review |
| Giant monolith components (500+ lines) | Decompose into atoms/molecules/organisms — if a component file exceeds 200 lines, it needs splitting |
| API types manually defined | Always generate types from OpenAPI specs — manual types drift from the API and cause runtime errors |
| `useEffect` for data fetching | Use React Query (or SWR) — handles caching, deduplication, refetching, loading/error states correctly |
| Inline styles and magic numbers | All visual values come from design tokens — no `color: '#3b82f6'` or `padding: '12px'` in components |
| No responsive testing | Test every page at 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1280px (desktop) — use Storybook viewport addon and Playwright viewport tests |
| Client-side rendering everything | Use SSR/SSG for SEO-critical pages (marketing, docs), RSC for data-heavy dashboards, client components only for interactivity |
| No error boundaries | Wrap route segments in error boundaries — one unhandled error in a widget should not crash the entire page |
| Storing auth tokens in localStorage | Use httpOnly cookies for SSR apps — localStorage is vulnerable to XSS, cookies get automatic CSRF protection with SameSite |
| `any` types in TypeScript | Enable `strict: true`, ban `any` in ESLint — use `unknown` with type narrowing or proper generics instead |
| No bundle size monitoring | Configure `@next/bundle-analyzer`, set CI budget checks — a single unnoticed dependency can add 100KB to initial load |
| Skipping form validation | Validate on both client (instant feedback) and server (security) — use Zod schemas shared with API layer |
| No dark mode from the start | Implement light/dark via CSS custom properties and theme provider from Phase 2 — retrofitting dark mode into an existing component library is extremely painful |
| Testing implementation details | Test behavior, not implementation — assert what the user sees and does, not internal component state or DOM structure |
| Using `<Link>` or `navigate()` for API routes, external URLs, or auth flows | Framework routers handle client-side page transitions ONLY. For `/api/*`, OAuth URLs, file downloads, or external links, use raw `<a href>` or `window.location`. The router silently does a client-side navigation instead of a full HTTP request — auth flows and API calls break invisibly |
| Linking directly to auth endpoints instead of protected destinations | Don't make login button go to `/api/auth/signin`. Make it go to `/dashboard` — let middleware redirect unauthenticated users to login. Duplicating the framework's auth flow creates conflicts and breaks redirect-after-login |
| Auth callback that always redirects to one page | The `signIn`/`redirect` callback must read `callbackUrl` AND **validate it is a same-origin / allowlisted RELATIVE path** before redirecting — reject absolute or cross-origin URLs (fall back to a safe default). Hardcoding `/dashboard` breaks "redirect back to where you were" for every deep link; redirecting to an unvalidated user-supplied `callbackUrl` is an **OPEN REDIRECT** (cross-ref `security-defaults.md` → "Validate ALL external input at the trust boundary") |
| Config override pointing to the default value | If `signIn: "/api/auth/signin"` IS the framework default, the override creates an infinite redirect loop. Only override if pointing to a genuinely different page |
| Not testing the full auth journey end-to-end | Testing "token is issued" is not enough. Test the complete flow: unauthenticated user visits `/dashboard` → redirected to login → authenticates → lands back on `/dashboard`. Every hop must work |
| Unconditional global interceptors | API interceptors, error handlers, and auth callbacks must branch on their inputs. A global redirect callback that ignores the `url` parameter and always returns `/dashboard` breaks every other redirect in the app |
| Inventing a frontend-only error shape | Parse the backend's RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` (`Problem`: type/title/status/detail/instance + `trace_id`/`errors[]`) and resolve user copy from the shared error catalog (`libs/shared/errors/catalog.*`) — don't re-declare titles/messages inline |
| Browser telemetry that no dashboard reads | EMIT the exact `observability-contract.md` names (`http_requests_total`, `http_request_duration_seconds`, web-vitals LCP/INP/CLS), inject W3C `traceparent` so the browser starts the trace, and report `window.onerror`/`unhandledrejection` + a global error boundary |
| Hardcoding perf thresholds (2.5s / 200KB) | Read `docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml` (`web_vitals`, `bundle`) into `lighthouserc.json` + `.size-limit.json`; these are CI gates, not docs |
| Rolling your own feature-flag system | Consume the shared OpenFeature client (`libs/shared/feature-flags/`) + registry (`config/feature-flags.yaml`) via a `useFlag` hook with SSR/edge-safe eval and fail-static safe defaults |
| Unsanitized `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` / missing CSP | Route all HTML through `lib/sanitize.ts` (DOMPurify, strict allowlist); serve a CSP with no `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` plus Trusted Types (`require-trusted-types-for 'script'`); `react/no-danger` ESLint rule on |
| External/CDN `<script>` with no integrity hash | Prefer self-hosting third-party scripts; any remaining external `<script>`/`<link>` carries an SRI `integrity` hash + `crossorigin` so a tampered CDN asset fails closed |
| Session cookie missing a name prefix, or sensitive page is cacheable | Name auth/session cookies with `__Host-`/`__Secure-` (in addition to `HttpOnly`+`Secure`+`SameSite`); set `Cache-Control: no-store` (+ `Pragma: no-cache`) on authenticated/sensitive responses so credentials/PII are never cached |
| Defaulting to Next.js regardless of product | Choose the framework by product archetype (Phase 1): Astro for content/marketing, Next.js App Router for full-stack SaaS, React+Vite for internal-tool SPAs, Remix for form-heavy apps — or match the architect's `tech-stack.md` / the brownfield stack |
| Hardcoded user-facing strings | Externalize ALL display text, `aria-label`s, placeholders, and validation messages into i18n keys; format numbers/dates/currency with `Intl`; never inline English in a component |
| Hardcoded `left`/`right` (RTL breaks) | Use CSS logical properties (`margin-inline`, `padding-inline-start`, `inset-inline`, `text-align: start`) and set `<html dir>` from the locale, so RTL works without per-component overrides |
| Raw `<img>` / unoptimized images | Use the `Image` primitive (framework optimizer): explicit width/height (zero CLS), lazy by default, AVIF/WebP, `priority` only for the LCP image; required `alt` |
| Public pages with no SEO | Indexable routes need unique metadata + canonical + Open Graph + JSON-LD structured data, plus generated `sitemap.xml` + `robots.txt`; auth routes are `noindex` |
| Data-fetch waterfalls / no code-splitting | Fetch independent data in parallel (RSC: start before `await`; SPA: parallel queries), stream with Suspense, dynamic-import heavy/below-the-fold components, prioritize the LCP image — stay within the bundle budget |
| Verifying flows by reasoning | The Phase-4b interaction trace is an EXECUTED Playwright smoke (`smoke.spec.ts`) run against the built app asserting final state — not a mental walk-through; a failing flow blocks Phase 5 |
| Ad-hoc form state / `useState` per field | Build forms on react-hook-form + Zod resolver (shared OpenAPI schemas); multi-step wizards, field arrays, server-error mapping to fields, a focusable error summary, autosave + unsaved-changes guard |
