**Fallback (if protocols not loaded):** Use AskUserQuestion with options (never open-ended), "Chat about this" last, recommended first. Work continuously. Print progress constantly. Validate inputs before starting — classify missing as Critical (stop), Degraded (warn, continue partial), or Optional (skip silently). Use parallel tool calls for independent reads. Use Grep to find the relevant lines, then Read with offset/limit.

## Brownfield Awareness

If `Shipyard/.orchestrator/codebase-context.md` exists and mode is `brownfield`:
- **READ existing architecture first** — understand current patterns, tech stack, API structure
- **Design around existing code** — new architecture extends the system, doesn't replace it
- **Document existing patterns in ADRs** — capture what's already decided
- **API contracts must be backward-compatible** — new endpoints, not breaking changes
- **Don't redesign what works** — focus architecture on the NEW features/requirements

## Engagement Mode

!`cat Shipyard/.orchestrator/settings.md 2>/dev/null || echo "No settings — using Standard"`

Read `Shipyard/.orchestrator/settings.md` at startup. Adapt discovery depth:

| Mode | Discovery Approach |
|------|-------------------|
| **Express** | Auto-derive from BRD. Ask only if critical info missing. Conservative defaults. |
| **Standard** | 5-7 questions across 2 rounds. Scale sizing + constraints. Fitness-derived architecture. |
| **Thorough** | 12-15 questions across 4 structured rounds. Full capacity planning. Trade-off analysis. Architecture alternatives. |
| **Meticulous** | Everything in Thorough + individual ADR approval, tech stack walkthrough, capacity modeling with cost estimates. |

### Always-Resolved Defaults (every mode, never Thorough-gated)

Regardless of engagement mode — including Express — these three artifacts are ALWAYS produced. They are DERIVED from the scale, data-type, and customer-segment answers (or, in Express, auto-derived from BRD signals + conservative defaults). They are never gated behind Thorough/Meticulous-only rounds, because frontend/qa/sre/devops/software-engineer skills READ them and will hardcode wrong values if they are absent:

| Always-resolved artifact | How it is resolved even in Express | Owner contract |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Performance budget** — `docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml` | Map the chosen scale + data-pattern to the default budget table in Phase 4 (e.g. small/balanced-CRUD → p95 500ms, LCP 2500ms, bundle 200KB). If no scale signal, use the small/balanced row. | solution-architect EMITS; frontend/qa/sre/devops READ — never hardcode 500ms/200KB. |
| **Compliance scope** — `Compliance & Controls` subsection + scoped framework set | Run the deterministic product-signals → frameworks map from `compliance-protocol.md` against BRD/security PII signals. No signal → record `out of scope: <framework> — no <signal>` (an explicit empty scope is still a resolved scope). | solution-architect designs CONTROLS into the design; compliance-officer maps/verifies. |
| **Feature-flag provider** — flag client + registry contract | Always resolve an OpenFeature-based provider with an env/config fallback and per-flag safe defaults (`libs/shared/feature-flags/`, `config/feature-flags.yaml`). In Express, default to the env/config provider with no external service. | software-engineer OWNS the client; architect records the provider choice + fallback in an ADR. |

Log on resolution: `✓ Defaults resolved — perf-budget {row}, compliance {frameworks|none}, flag-provider {provider}`.

## Overview

Full architecture pipeline: from business requirements to a scaffolded, production-ready codebase. The architecture is DERIVED from project constraints (scale, team, budget, compliance) — not picked from a template. There is no one-size-fits-all architecture.

Generates architecture deliverables at the project root (`api/`, `schemas/`, `docs/architecture/`, project scaffold) with workspace artifacts in `Shipyard/solution-architect/`.

## Config Paths

Read `.shipyard.yaml` at startup. Use these overrides if defined:
- `paths.api_contracts` — default: `api/`
- `paths.adrs` — default: `docs/architecture/architecture-decision-records/`
- `paths.architecture_docs` — default: `docs/architecture/`
- `paths.erd` — default: `schemas/erd.md`
- `paths.migrations` — default: `schemas/migrations/`
- `paths.tech_stack` — default: `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`

Deliverables go to the **project root** (`api/`, `schemas/`, `docs/architecture/`). Workspace artifacts go to `Shipyard/solution-architect/`.

## When to Use

- Designing a new SaaS product or platform
- Planning microservices or service-oriented architecture
- Selecting tech stacks for production systems
- Creating API contracts and data models
- Scaffolding multi-cloud, production-ready projects
- Architecture review or modernization of existing systems

}
```

## Phase 1: Discovery & Scale Assessment

The architecture must fit the project's actual constraints. This phase gathers those constraints — at a depth matching the engagement mode.

### Step 1: Read Existing Context

Before asking ANY questions, read in parallel:
1. `Shipyard/polymath/handoff/context-package.md` — may contain scale, constraints, decisions
2. `Shipyard/product-manager/BRD/brd.md` — user stories, acceptance criteria, business rules
3. `Shipyard/.orchestrator/codebase-context.md` — brownfield context

**Reduce questions to cover ONLY gaps not addressed in existing context.** If polymath or PM already established scale targets, do not re-ask.

### Step 2: Scale & Fitness Interview

Adapt depth to engagement mode. Use AskUserQuestion with structured options (never open-ended).

#### Express Mode

Skip interview entirely. Auto-derive from BRD signals:
- User count hints from user stories -> default to "small" (< 1K users) if no signals
- Tech mentions in BRD or polymath context -> use those, else conservative defaults
- Default: modular monolith, managed services, single region, single DB
- Log: `✓ Express mode — auto-deriving architecture from BRD`

If a critical constraint is completely missing (e.g., BRD mentions "enterprise customers" but no scale number), ask ONE clarifying question maximum.

#### Standard Mode (2 rounds)

**Round 1 — Scale & Users:**

```python
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
  "question": "I need to understand your scale to design the right architecture.\n\n"
    "These 3 questions determine whether you need a simple monolith or a distributed system.",
  "header": "Scale & Users",
  "options": [
    {"label": "Small scale — < 1K users, MVP or internal tool", "description": "Simple architecture, minimal infra, fast to build"},
    {"label": "Medium scale — 1K-100K users, startup/growth", "description": "Needs to scale but not from day 1. Service extraction plan."},

#### Thorough Mode (4 rounds)

Everything in Standard, PLUS two additional rounds:

**Round 3 — Technical Requirements:**

```python

  ],

}])
```

#### Meticulous Mode

Everything in Thorough, PLUS:
- After the fitness function produces an architecture, present **2-3 alternative architectures** with explicit trade-off tables (cost vs complexity vs scalability vs team fit) before the user chooses
- **Individual ADR approval**: present each ADR separately. User reviews and approves each decision.
- **Capacity modeling**: estimate infrastructure cost at current scale AND 10x projected scale
- **Tech stack walkthrough**: for each major tech choice, present 2-3 alternatives with rationale

### Step 3: Architecture Fitness Function

After gathering inputs, DERIVE the architecture from constraints. The architecture is a FUNCTION of the inputs — not a template.

**Architecture Pattern:**

| Scale | Team | -> Pattern |
|-------|------|------------|
| < 1K users | 1-3 people | **Monolith** or **Modular Monolith**. Single deploy, single DB. Docker Compose for local dev. |
| 1K-100K users | 3-15 people | **Modular Monolith** with documented service boundaries. Extract services ONLY when team or scale demands. Include service extraction plan in ADR. |
| 100K+ users | 15+ people | **Microservices**. Service mesh, distributed data, event-driven communication. Each team owns 1-3 services. |
| Any scale | Solo developer | Whatever is simplest. Serverless or monolith. Managed everything. Minimize operational burden. |

**Infrastructure Sizing:**

| Budget | -> Infrastructure Strategy |
|--------|---------------------------|
| < $500/mo | Serverless-first (Lambda/Cloud Run), managed DB (RDS free tier/PlanetScale), no K8s, CloudWatch/basic monitoring |
| $500-5K/mo | Managed K8s (EKS/GKE) or ECS, managed DB with replicas, Redis cache, standard monitoring (Grafana/Datadog) |
| > $5K/mo | Dedicated infrastructure, self-hosted options viable, custom observability stack, multi-region possible |

**Data Architecture:**

| Data Pattern | -> Strategy |
|-------------|-------------|
| Read-heavy (>80% reads) | Cache-first (Redis), read replicas, CDN for static, materialized views |
| Write-heavy | Event sourcing or CQRS, queue-buffered writes (SQS/Kafka), eventual consistency |
| Real-time | WebSocket/SSE infrastructure, pub/sub (Redis Pub/Sub or Kafka), in-memory state |
| Balanced CRUD | Standard relational DB, connection pooling, query optimization |

**Compliance Impact** (ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY — directional architecture cues, NOT the authoritative map):

> This table sketches the *shape* of the architectural change each regime tends to demand, to steer the fitness function. It is **not** the source of truth and intentionally omits specifics. The single source of truth for which frameworks are in scope and which controls are mandatory is the deterministic **product-signals → frameworks** map in `Shipyard/.protocols/compliance-protocol.md`, materialized in the Phase 2 **Compliance & Controls** subsection (which designs the concrete controls in). Any specific scan cadence, breach-notification window, control id, article, or §-citation is **NOT** stated here and MUST be verified LIVE per `freshness-protocol.md` in that subsection — never from memory (the same BINDING freshness rule the Compliance & Controls subsection carries). compliance-officer later maps/verifies those controls to evidence.

| Requirement | -> Architecture cue (illustrative) |
|------------|------------------------|
| GDPR | Data residency controls, right-to-deletion pipeline, consent management, PII encryption |
| CCPA / CPRA | Do-not-sell/share opt-out plumbing, data-category lookback support, consumer access/deletion requests |
| SOC2 / ISO 27001 | Audit trail on all mutations, RBAC, centralized logging, access review automation |
| HIPAA | Dedicated tenancy, encryption at rest + transit, BAA with all vendors, audit logging, no shared infrastructure |
| PCI DSS | Tokenize card data (use Stripe/Adyen), network segmentation, periodic vulnerability scanning, no raw card storage |
| FedRAMP | Defined authorization boundary, NIST 800-53-aligned control baseline, continuous monitoring, US-region/data-handling boundaries |

**Availability Impact:**

| SLA | -> Architecture Changes |
|-----|------------------------|
| 99% (3.7 days/yr) | Single instance OK, basic health checks |
| 99.9% (8.7 hrs/yr) | Multi-AZ, load balancer, automated restarts, basic monitoring |
| 99.99% (52 min/yr) | Multi-AZ with automated failover, zero-downtime deploys, chaos engineering, comprehensive monitoring |
| 99.999% (5 min/yr) | Multi-region active-active, global load balancing, circuit breakers everywhere, dedicated SRE |

**Growth Model Impact:**

| Growth | -> Architecture Changes |
|--------|------------------------|
| Linear/steady | Plan for 10x. Vertical scaling first, horizontal when needed. |
| Hockey stick | Horizontal scaling from day 1. Stateless services. Auto-scaling groups. Queue-buffered writes. Feature flags for load shedding. |
| Seasonal | Scale-to-zero capable (serverless/spot instances). Pre-warming automation. Burst capacity planning. |
| Platform/API | API gateway, rate limiting, webhook system, developer portal, backwards-compatible versioning from day 1. |

**Present the derived architecture:** "Based on your constraints [summary], here's what fits and why..."

For **Thorough/Meticulous** modes, also present 1-2 alternative architectures:
- **Conservative alternative**: simpler, faster to build, may need rework at scale
- **Ambitious alternative**: handles more future growth, higher upfront complexity and cost

Each alternative includes a trade-off summary: build time, operational complexity, monthly cost estimate, scaling ceiling, team fit.

## Phase 2: Architecture Design

Generate architecture documents in `docs/architecture/` (or `paths.architecture_docs` from config):

### architecture-decision-records/
One ADR per major decision using this template:
```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Title]
**Status:** Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated
**Context:** Why this decision is needed
**Decision:** What we chose and why
**Consequences:** Trade-offs accepted
**Alternatives Considered:** What we rejected and why
```

Required ADRs:
- Architecture pattern (monolith, microservices, modular monolith, event-driven)
- **Architecture-style & layering ADR (REQUIRED, per `architecture-boundaries.md`)** — see below
- Communication patterns (sync REST/gRPC, async messaging, CQRS)
- Data strategy (shared DB, DB-per-service, event sourcing)
- Auth architecture (JWT, OAuth2, session-based)
- Multi-tenancy strategy (row-level, schema-level, DB-level)
- Feature-flag provider ADR (OpenFeature provider + env/config fallback + per-flag safe defaults, per the always-resolved defaults above)

#### Architecture-Style & Layering ADR (REQUIRED — emit `ADR-NNN-architecture-style.md`)

Emit an ADR that documents the Clean/Hexagonal layering and the **dependency-direction rule** per `Shipyard/.protocols/architecture-boundaries.md`. It is the design-time source of truth for the boundary that software-engineer enforces MECHANICALLY (`make arch`, exit non-zero on violation) — the architect declares the law; the engineer wires the fitness function. The ADR MUST state:

- The layer stack innermost→outermost: **domain** (entities/value-objects/business rules, zero framework/IO imports) → **application** (use-cases + PORT interfaces) → **infrastructure/adapters** (frameworks, DB drivers, HTTP clients, ORMs, SDKs).
- **The one law:** source-code dependencies (imports) point INWARD only; a framework/ORM/HTTP/DB import in the domain is a HIGH-severity, build-blocking violation.
- **Ports owned inside, adapters bound at the composition root** — use-cases receive ports via constructor/parameter injection; only `main`/bootstrap/DI module names concrete adapters.
- A pointer to the per-language fitness function software-engineer will emit (`.dependency-cruiser.js` / ArchUnit / `.importlinter` / `deptrac.yaml` / `.go-arch-lint.yml`) and the `make arch` CI gate. Note explicitly: **the architect does not implement the lint; it specifies the rule the lint must encode.**

#### Compliance & Controls (REQUIRED subsection — design controls in, do not just name regulations)

Consume `Shipyard/.protocols/compliance-protocol.md`. Run the deterministic **product-signals → frameworks** map against the BRD, the security-engineer PII inventory (if present), and any `compliance:` block in `.shipyard.yaml`. This subsection is ALWAYS produced (see Always-Resolved Defaults) — when no signal scopes a framework, record `out of scope: <framework> — no <signal>` so the empty scope is auditable.

When a signal indicates regulated data, the architect DESIGNS the required CONTROLS into the system design (not advice — concrete architecture) and records them in a control table:

| Control area | Designed-in mechanism (record the concrete design decision) |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Audit logging | Append-only audit trail on all mutations (who/what/when/before-after); tamper-evident store; which entities are audited |
| Encryption at rest | KMS-backed envelope encryption for PII/PHI columns + storage; key rotation policy; which fields |
| Encryption in transit | TLS 1.2+ everywhere incl. service-to-service; mTLS where the framework requires dedicated tenancy |
| RBAC / authorization | Role model + per-object (default-deny) authz design feeding `security-defaults.md`; tenant + object-id checks at the data layer |
| Retention & deletion | Retention windows per data class; right-to-erasure / right-to-delete pipeline (GDPR/CCPA); soft-delete vs hard-delete policy |
| Data residency | Region pinning + replication boundaries for EU/regulated data; where data may and may not flow |
| Consent | Consent capture + lawful-basis recording (GDPR Arts. 5–11) where personal data is processed |

- **Freshness rule (BINDING):** any specific control id, article number, §-citation, or statutory clock (e.g. GDPR 72-hour breach notice, HIPAA breach notice window) is verified LIVE against the official source this session per `compliance-protocol.md` — NEVER written from memory. If it cannot be verified live, mark it `not verified`; do not fabricate.
- Each designed control becomes an Implementing-artifact target the compliance-officer will later map to evidence (`path:line`). The architect's job is to ensure the design HAS a place for each mandatory control.

### system-diagrams/
Create Mermaid diagrams in markdown files:
- **C4 Context** — system boundaries and external actors
- **C4 Container** — services, databases, message brokers, CDN
- **Sequence diagrams** — for critical user flows (auth, payment, data pipeline)
- **Infrastructure topology** — cloud resources and networking

### Design Principles
Apply and document these production patterns:
- **12/15-Factor App methodology** — explicit design intent, documented factor-by-factor in `design-principles.md`. Config strictly from the environment (no config in code), strict dev/prod parity, stateless processes, port binding, disposability/graceful shutdown, logs as event streams to **stdout** (per `observability-contract.md` — the app never owns log files/rotation). Carry the 15-factor extensions: **API-first**, **telemetry** (RED metrics + traces + structured logs per the observability contract), and **authentication/authorization as a first-class concern** (per `security-defaults.md`).
- Defense in depth (security layers) — aligns with `security-defaults.md` (input validation at the boundary, parameterized queries, output encoding, SSRF allowlist, secrets from env/secret-manager, per-object default-deny authz, security headers + strict CORS + secure cookies)
- Clean/Hexagonal layering with inward-only dependencies (see the Architecture-Style & Layering ADR; mechanically enforced by software-engineer)
- Circuit breaker, retry, timeout patterns
- Idempotency for all write operations (realized as the reusable `IdempotencyKey` header contract in Phase 4)
- Eventual consistency where appropriate
- Zero-trust networking

### Phase 2 Quality Bar (gate — do not proceed to Phase 3 until all true)

- [ ] Architecture-style & layering ADR emitted, declaring the inward-only dependency-direction law + the `make arch` gate software-engineer will enforce.
- [ ] Feature-flag provider ADR emitted (OpenFeature provider + env/config fallback + per-flag safe defaults).
- [ ] `Compliance & Controls` subsection produced with a resolved scope (frameworks scoped IN, or explicit `out of scope — no <signal>`); any cited control id/article/clock is `[verified]` live or marked `not verified`.
- [ ] 12/15-factor design intent documented factor-by-factor in `design-principles.md`.
- [ ] **`security-defaults checklist passes`** — the design leaves a concrete place for every secure-by-default control (boundary validation, parameterized data access, per-object default-deny authz, secrets from env/secret-manager, security headers/CORS/cookies) so the BUILD agents can ship it without retrofit.

**Present architecture to user via AskUserQuestion for approval before proceeding.**

## Phase 3: Tech Stack Selection

Generate `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md` (or `paths.tech_stack` from config):

| Layer | Selection | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Language(s) | Based on team/requirements | Performance, ecosystem, hiring |
| Framework | Based on language choice | Maturity, community, features |
| Database(s) | Based on data patterns | ACID vs BASE, query patterns |
| Cache | Redis/Memcached | Access patterns, consistency needs |
| Message Broker | Kafka/RabbitMQ/SQS/Pub-Sub | Throughput, ordering, durability |
| API Gateway | Kong/AWS API GW/GCP API GW | Rate limiting, auth, routing |
| Auth | Keycloak/Auth0/Cognito/Firebase Auth | SSO, MFA, compliance |
| Search | Elasticsearch/OpenSearch | Full-text, analytics, scale |
| Object Storage | S3/GCS/Azure Blob | Cost, lifecycle, CDN integration |
| CDN | CloudFront/Cloud CDN/Azure CDN | Edge locations, cost |

Selection criteria: production maturity, multi-cloud portability, team expertise, cost at scale.

## Phase 4: API Contract Design

Generate API contracts at `api/` (or `paths.api_contracts` from config) at the project root:

- **OpenAPI 3.1 specs** for REST APIs — complete with request/response schemas, auth, error codes
- **gRPC proto files** if inter-service communication is gRPC
- **AsyncAPI specs** for event-driven interfaces
- **API versioning strategy** documented (URL path vs header)

The architect OWNS the cross-skill API contracts below. software-engineer (runtime mapping), technical-writer (error table/docs), and code-reviewer (consume + verify) READ these — they are defined ONCE here as reusable OpenAPI components and `$ref`'d everywhere.

### Canonical error contract — RFC 9457 `Problem` (application/problem+json)

**Replace the bespoke `{code, message, details, trace_id}` envelope.** The canonical error contract is RFC 9457 `application/problem+json`. Define a single reusable component schema named **`Problem`** in `api/openapi/components.yaml` (or the shared `components` block) and `$ref` it from EVERY error response (4xx/5xx). The architect OWNS this schema.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    Problem:
      type: object
      description: RFC 9457 problem detail. The canonical error body for every 4xx/5xx response.
      required: [type, title, status]
      properties:
        type:     { type: string, format: uri-reference, default: "about:blank",
                    description: "URI reference identifying the problem type (stable per error code)." }
        title:    { type: string, description: "Short, human-readable summary; stable per type." }
        status:   { type: integer, format: int32, minimum: 100, maximum: 599 }
        detail:   { type: string, description: "Human-readable explanation specific to this occurrence." }
        instance: { type: string, format: uri-reference, description: "URI reference identifying this occurrence." }
        # standard extensions (cross-skill contract):
        trace_id: { type: string, description: "Correlation id; matches the observability-contract trace_id." }
        errors:
          type: array
          description: "Field-level validation errors."
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              field:   { type: string, description: "Field name OR JSON Pointer (e.g. /items/0/qty)." }
              pointer: { type: string }
              detail:  { type: string }
```

Rules:
- Every error response sets **`Content-Type: application/problem+json`** and `$ref`s `#/components/schemas/Problem` — no inline error bodies, no second error shape anywhere in the spec.
- `trace_id` is the SAME correlation id as the observability contract's `trace_id` (read from the live span). Do not invent a parallel id.
- **Error catalog is the source of truth for the values.** `Problem.type`/`title`/`status` are populated at runtime from a single error-catalog module (`libs/shared/errors/catalog.*`) with entries `{ code, http_status, title, message_template, remediation, docs_anchor }`. BOTH the runtime mapper (app error → `Problem`) and the technical-writer's docs error table READ this one catalog. The architect specifies the catalog's existence + shape in an ADR / scaffold stub; software-engineer implements the mapping.

### Reusable `IdempotencyKey` header — REQUIRED on all unsafe POST/PATCH

Declare a reusable header parameter and require it on every non-idempotent mutation:

```yaml
components:
  parameters:
    IdempotencyKey:
      name: Idempotency-Key
      in: header
      required: true
      schema: { type: string, format: uuid }
      description: >
        Client-generated key. Replaying the same key with the SAME request returns the original
        result (replay). Reusing a key with a DIFFERENT request body returns 409 Conflict; a malformed
        key returns 422. Servers persist key→result for a documented retention window.
```

- Every unsafe `POST`/`PATCH` (and any non-idempotent `PUT`/`DELETE`) `$ref`s `parameters/IdempotencyKey` and documents `409` (key reuse with mismatched body) and `422` (malformed key) responses — both `$ref` `Problem`.
- This is the spec-level realization of the "idempotency for all write operations" design principle.

### Reusable `CursorPage<T>` pagination — REQUIRED on every list endpoint

Every list/collection endpoint returns the cursor-page envelope (cursor-based for production; `offset` only for admin/internal):

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    PageInfo:
      type: object
      required: [has_more, limit]
      properties:
        next_cursor: { type: string, nullable: true, description: "Opaque cursor for the next page; null at the end." }
        has_more:    { type: boolean }
        limit:       { type: integer, minimum: 1 }
    # CursorPage<T> is composed per resource: data[] of T + page_info.
    # e.g. UserPage: { allOf: [ { properties: { data: { type: array, items: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/User' } },
    #                                            page_info: { $ref: '#/components/schemas/PageInfo' } } } ] }
```

- Shape is fixed: `data[]` (the items) + `page_info { next_cursor, has_more, limit }`. Every list endpoint `$ref`s `PageInfo` and supplies a typed `data[]`.

### OpenAPI Governance — validate + lint, BLOCK handoff until clean

After writing `api/openapi/*.yaml`, the spec is NOT handed off until it is **valid AND clean**:

1. **Structural validation** — run an OpenAPI 3.1 validator (e.g. `redocly lint` / `swagger-cli validate` / `openapi-spec-validator`). Spec must parse and be schema-valid.
2. **Spectral ruleset lint** — author/emit a default ruleset at **`api/.spectral.yaml`** (a new artifact this skill OWNS) and run `spectral lint api/openapi/*.yaml`. The default ruleset MUST assert at minimum:
   - extends `spectral:oas`;
   - every operation has an `operationId`, `summary`, and `tags`;
   - every `4xx`/`5xx` response `$ref`s `#/components/schemas/Problem` and uses `application/problem+json`;
   - every unsafe `POST`/`PATCH` references `parameters/IdempotencyKey`;
   - every list/array-returning operation uses the `PageInfo`/cursor-page envelope;
   - no inline error schemas; security scheme declared; no `$ref` to undefined components.
3. **BLOCKING gate:** any validator error or Spectral error blocks the phase. Handoff to software-engineer/technical-writer happens only on validator exit 0 AND `spectral lint` with zero errors (warnings recorded). Cite the actual tool output — never assert "the spec is clean" without an observed exit 0.

### Performance Budget Artifact — `docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml` (single source of truth)

Emit `docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml` per the shared PERFORMANCE BUDGET contract. This is the ONE place perf targets live; frontend/qa/sre/devops READ it and MUST NOT hardcode 500ms/200KB. It is ALWAYS emitted (see Always-Resolved Defaults) — even in Express/Standard mode resolve a sensible default from the chosen scale + data-type.

Shape:
```yaml
# docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml
api:
  "GET /users/{id}":      { p95_ms: 300, p99_ms: 800, throughput_rps: 200, error_rate_pct: 0.5 }
  "POST /orders":         { p95_ms: 500, p99_ms: 1200, throughput_rps: 100, error_rate_pct: 1.0 }
web_vitals:
  lcp_ms: 2500
  inp_ms: 200
  cls: 0.1
bundle:
  main:   { max_kb: 200 }
  vendor: { max_kb: 350 }
```

**Default-resolution table** (apply when the user gives no explicit numbers — derive from scale + data-pattern; route-level rows default to the per-tier API row):

| Scale / data-type | api p95 / p99 (ms) | throughput (rps) | error_rate (%) | web_vitals (lcp/inp/cls) | bundle main (KB) |
|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| Small / balanced-CRUD (default) | 500 / 1200 | 50 | 1.0 | 2500 / 200 / 0.1 | 200 |
| Medium / read-heavy | 300 / 800 | 200 | 0.5 | 2000 / 200 / 0.1 | 200 |
| Medium / write-heavy | 500 / 1500 | 150 | 1.0 | 2500 / 200 / 0.1 | 200 |
| Large / high-availability | 200 / 500 | 1000 | 0.1 | 1800 / 150 / 0.1 | 180 |
| Real-time | 150 / 400 | 500 | 0.5 | 2000 / 100 / 0.1 | 200 |

These align with the latency/availability rows in the Phase 1 fitness function and the `http_request_duration_seconds` instrument in `observability-contract.md` (note the budget is in **ms** for human-readability; the runtime histogram is in **seconds**).

Standards enforced:
- **Canonical error body is RFC 9457 `Problem`** (above) — no `{code, message, details, trace_id}` envelope.
- Pagination via the reusable `CursorPage<T>` / `PageInfo` envelope (`cursor-based` for production, `offset` only for admin).
- Idempotency via the reusable `IdempotencyKey` header on all unsafe writes.
- Rate limiting headers (`X-RateLimit-*`)
- Request ID propagation (`X-Request-ID`) — echoed into the log `request_id` field per the observability contract.

### Phase 4 Quality Bar (gate — do not hand off until all true)

- [ ] Reusable `Problem` schema defined ONCE; every 4xx/5xx response `$ref`s it and serves `application/problem+json`; zero inline error bodies.
- [ ] Error-catalog source-of-truth (`libs/shared/errors/catalog.*` shape) specified for runtime + docs to read.
- [ ] `IdempotencyKey` header declared once and `$ref`'d on every unsafe POST/PATCH, with 409/422 responses.
- [ ] `PageInfo`/cursor-page envelope declared once and used by every list endpoint.
- [ ] `api/.spectral.yaml` default ruleset emitted; OpenAPI validator AND `spectral lint` both run with **zero errors** (observed exit 0) before handoff.
- [ ] `docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml` emitted with a resolved budget (explicit numbers or default-table row); no hardcoded perf targets elsewhere.

## Phase 5: Data Model Design

Generate data models at `schemas/` at the project root:

- **ERD diagrams** in Mermaid (at `paths.erd` from config, default `schemas/erd.md`)
- **SQL migration files** (numbered, idempotent) (at `paths.migrations` from config, default `schemas/migrations/`)
- **NoSQL collection schemas** (if applicable)
- **Data flow diagrams** — showing how data moves between services
- **Audit trail schema** — who changed what, when

Standards enforced:
- Soft deletes with `deleted_at` timestamps
- UUID primary keys (not auto-increment) for distributed systems
- Created/updated timestamps on all entities
- Tenant isolation at the data layer
- PII field identification and encryption strategy

## Phase 6: Project Scaffolding

Scaffold the project root structure directly. The scaffold IS the project root — there is no separate scaffold directory.

```
project root/
├── services/
│   └── <service-name>/
│       ├── src/
│       ├── tests/
│       ├── Dockerfile
│       ├── Makefile
│       └── README.md
├── libs/
│   └── shared/          # Shared types, utils, clients
├── docker-compose.yml   # Local dev environment
├── Makefile             # Root-level commands
└── README.md            # Getting started guide
```

Each service includes:
- Health check endpoint (`/healthz`, `/readyz`)
- Structured logging (JSON, correlation IDs)
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Configuration from environment variables
- Basic test structure (unit, integration)
- Dockerfile (multi-stage, non-root user, minimal base image)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Picking architecture before knowing constraints | Run the fitness function FIRST. Scale, team, budget determine the pattern. |
| Microservices for a 2-person team | Start modular monolith, extract services when team/scale demands |
| Kubernetes for < 1K users | Docker Compose or serverless. K8s operational cost > benefit at small scale. |
| Same architecture for $200/mo and $20K/mo | Budget changes everything — serverless vs dedicated, managed vs self-hosted |
| Shared database across services | Each service owns its data, communicate via APIs/events |
| No API versioning strategy | Decide v1 URL path versioning from day one |
| Bespoke `{code, message, details}` error envelope | Use the reusable RFC 9457 `Problem` schema; `$ref` it from every error response; `application/problem+json` |
| Inventing a parallel error/trace id | `Problem.trace_id` is the SAME id as the observability-contract `trace_id` (live span) |
| Handing off an unvalidated OpenAPI spec | Run the validator + `spectral lint api/.spectral.yaml`; BLOCK handoff until both exit 0 |
| Hardcoding 500ms/200KB in frontend/qa/sre | Emit `docs/architecture/performance-budget.yaml`; downstream skills READ it |
| Naming a regulation without designing the control | Design audit-log/encryption/RBAC/retention/residency/consent INTO the system; record in Compliance & Controls |
| Citing a control id / statutory clock from memory | Verify it live against the official source this session, or mark `not verified` |
| Skipping ADRs | Future-you needs to know WHY, not just WHAT |
| Over-engineering auth | Use managed auth (Auth0/Cognito) unless compliance requires self-hosted |
| Ignoring multi-tenancy from start | Retrofitting tenant isolation is 10x harder than designing it in |
| Skipping scale interview | "Build a SaaS" means nothing without scale context. 100 users vs 10M users is a completely different system. |
| Ignoring engagement mode | Express: auto-derive. Standard: 2 rounds. Thorough: 4 rounds. Meticulous: full walkthrough. Read settings.md. |
| Designing for 10M users when there are 100 | Design for current + 10x. Not 1000x. Over-engineering kills velocity. |
| Not presenting alternatives in Thorough/Meticulous | Users at those engagement levels want to understand trade-offs, not just see one answer. |
